# LittleJS Tilemap Study

Learning to load tilemaps into the [LittleJS](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS) game engine

The purpose of this project was to study the way LittleJS can build the map from a TMJ file (exported from Tiled)

I used the [platformer](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/tree/main/examples/platformer) example as a reference. For this example, I omitted collisions, and objects
